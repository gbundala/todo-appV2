# Cars Task 7

## Installation and using the application

This application includes both the frontend created with ReactJS and the backend part created with ExpressJS and the database setup with MongoDB.

If you need to see this application in action in development mode you can download the source files in your local environment then **`npm install`** to install the dependencies. Then you can start the server with **`npm start`** while you are in the root of the repository. This command will run the nodemon script that will be restarting the server on each change you make in the code. Nodemon is also really helpful in the stage that the application is deployed in production by automatically restarting the server when it crashes.

Next, You then need to `cd` into the `frontend` directory and do the same by running **`npm install`** to install the ReactJS dependencies in the frontend then run **`npm start`** as well to start the frontend part of the application. Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/.

You may also clone the repo from https://github.com/gbundala/cars-task7 in your local environment or download the zip file from Github and follow the installation steps (instructions) above.

> Happy Coding!
